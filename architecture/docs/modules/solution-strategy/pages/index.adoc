= Solution Strategy

Key Questions to Answer:

== 1. Architectural Approach
- Why choose a component-based architecture instead of a monolithic AI platform?
- What drove the layered design (Kubernetes → Agentic Layer → Workforces → Management)?
- How does this architecture achieve the 4 key advantages (sovereignty, agnosticity, compliance, extensibility)?

== 2. Technology Decisions
- Why Kubernetes as the foundational platform? (vs. other orchestration platforms)
- Why the AI Gateway/Model Router pattern for LLM abstraction?
- What drove the multi-framework runtime approach?
- Why open-source over proprietary solutions?

== 3. Quality Goal Achievement
- How does the architecture deliver data sovereignty and compliance?
- What patterns enable vendor agnosticism and prevent lock-in?
- How does the design support enterprise-scale orchestration?
- What makes it audit-ready and governance-friendly?

== 4. Integration Strategy
- How do components integrate into existing enterprise platforms?
- What are the key deployment patterns (BYOC, on-premise, hybrid)?
- How does the Agent Catalog and governance model work?

== Information Needed:
1. Design Philosophy: Core principles driving architectural decisions
2. Technology Rationale: Why Kubernetes specifically? Other platforms considered?
3. Component Evolution: How did you arrive at these specific components?
4. Enterprise Integration: Typical integration scenarios being targeted
5. Open Source Strategy: What drove the open source decision?
6. Quality Tradeoffs: Architectural tradeoffs made to achieve key advantages?
