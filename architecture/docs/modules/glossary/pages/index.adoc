= Glossary

This glossary defines the key terms and concepts used throughout the Agentic Layer architecture documentation.

== A

**Agent Catalog**::
Centralized registry and management system for discovering, versioning, and managing the lifecycle of AI agents within the platform. Provides metadata, documentation, and operational status for all registered agents.

**Agent Gateway**::
Entry point and routing component that handles incoming requests and distributes them to appropriate AI agents based on capabilities, availability, and load balancing policies.

**Agent Runtime / Agent Orchestration**::
Kubernetes-native execution environment that manages the lifecycle, scaling, and resource allocation of AI agents. Provides automated deployment, scaling, and monitoring of agent instances.

**Agentic Layer**::
Core platform layer containing the foundational components for AI agent orchestration, including AI Gateway, Agent Runtime, Connectors & Tools, and governance components. Built on Kubernetes infrastructure.

**Agentic Workforce Management**::
Component responsible for coordinating and orchestrating complex AI workflows across multiple agents and organizational boundaries. Manages task distribution, workflow execution, and inter-agent communication.

**Agentic Workforces**::
Application-level implementations of AI agent systems designed for specific enterprise use cases, such as Insurance Claims Processing, Healthcare Operations, or Procurement workflows.

**AI Gateway / Model Router**::
Unified interface component that abstracts interactions with multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers. Provides intelligent routing, failover capabilities, and consistent API interfaces across different AI service providers.

**AI Guardrails**::
Security and safety component that implements content filtering, safety checks, access controls, and policy enforcement for AI interactions to ensure compliant and secure operations.

**Audit Trail**::
Comprehensive logging and tracking system that records all AI operations, decisions, and interactions for regulatory compliance, security monitoring, and operational transparency.

== B

**BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud)**::
Deployment model that allows organizations to run the Agentic Layer components within their own cloud infrastructure, maintaining full control over data, security, and compliance requirements.

== C

**Cloud-Native Architecture**::
Design approach leveraging cloud computing principles, including containerization, microservices, dynamic orchestration, and declarative APIs. Built specifically for cloud environments with Kubernetes as the foundation.

**Compliance Dashboard**::
Management interface providing real-time monitoring and reporting for regulatory compliance requirements including EU AI Act, GDPR, and industry-specific standards.

**Connectors & Tools**::
Integration components that enable seamless connectivity between the Agentic Layer and external systems, databases, APIs, and third-party services.

**Control Plane for Intelligent Workloads**::
The Agentic Layer's primary function as a management and orchestration system for AI-driven processes and autonomous agents within enterprise environments.

== D

**Data Sovereignty**::
The concept of maintaining complete control and governance over data location, processing, and access within defined jurisdictional and organizational boundaries.

== K

**Kubernetes Platform**::
The foundational infrastructure layer providing container orchestration, scaling, resource management, and service discovery for all Agentic Layer components.

**Kubernetes-Native**::
Architecture and components designed specifically to leverage Kubernetes primitives, APIs, and operational patterns for deployment, scaling, and management.

== L

**LLM (Large Language Model)**::
AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. Examples include GPT, Gemini, Claude, and other foundation models accessed through the AI Gateway.

== M

**Multi-Framework Runtime**::
Execution environment that supports agents built with different AI frameworks and technologies while providing consistent operational characteristics and management interfaces.

== O

**Observability Dashboard**::
Operational interface providing comprehensive monitoring, metrics visualization, distributed tracing, and system health information for the entire Agentic Layer platform.

== T

**Testbench**::
Integrated testing framework providing automated validation, performance testing, and quality assurance capabilities for AI agents before production deployment.

== V

**Vendor Lock-in**::
Dependency on a specific vendor's proprietary technologies that makes switching to alternatives difficult or costly. The Agentic Layer's open-source and agnostic design prevents vendor lock-in.
