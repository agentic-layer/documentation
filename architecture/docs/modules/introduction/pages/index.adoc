= Introduction and Goals

== Purpose and Scope

The Agentic Layer serves as a control plane for intelligent workloads, providing a comprehensive suite of components that coordinate and orchestrate AI agents within enterprise environments. The system is architected as modular, reusable components built on a **Kubernetes Platform** foundation, enabling integration into existing enterprise infrastructure while maintaining operational sovereignty and compliance requirements.

The architecture is structured in multiple layers built on Kubernetes:

* **Kubernetes Platform**: The foundational infrastructure layer providing container orchestration, scaling, and resource management
* **Agentic Layer**: Core platform components including AI Gateway/Model Router, Agent Runtime Agent Orchestration, Connectors & Tools, Agentic Workforce Management, AI Guardrails, Testbench, Audit Trail, and Compliance Dashboard
* **Agentic Workforces**: Application-level agent implementations for specific use cases (e.g., Insurance Claims Processing, Healthcare Operations, Procurement)
* **Management Interface**: Operational components including Agent Gateway, Agent Catalog, and Observability Dashboard for system administration

* **Yellow boxes** represent planned components that are not yet implemented

This color coding provides visibility into the current development status and planned roadmap for the Agentic Layer platform.

== Key Advantages

The Agentic Layer provides several architectural advantages for enterprise AI deployments:

=== Data Sovereignty and Infrastructure Control
**Operational Independence and Regulatory Compliance**

The system enables complete sovereignty over data, models, and infrastructure through support for both cloud and on-premise deployments. This design ensures sensitive data and AI processing remain within defined infrastructure boundaries while meeting data residency and regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions.

=== Orchestrated Workflow Integration
**Enterprise-Scale Process Coordination**

The architecture transforms isolated AI agent invocations into coordinated, enterprise-wide processes. The platform handles distribution, control, and monitoring of agent workforces, enabling complex AI workflow orchestration across organizational boundaries.

=== Technology Agnosticism and Open Standards
**Vendor Independence and Architectural Flexibility**

Built on open-source principles and agnostic design patterns, the system prevents vendor lock-in while providing transparency into system operations. The architecture supports free choice of cloud providers, AI models, and integration tools, ensuring adaptability to evolving technology landscapes.

=== Regulatory Compliance and Governance
**Built-in Audit and Security Framework**

The system incorporates comprehensive governance, transparency, and audit capabilities from the architectural foundation. Built-in compliance with regulations including EU AI Act and GDPR through comprehensive logging, security controls with integrated guardrails, and adherence to industry security standards.

== Technical Features & Properties

The system architecture incorporates the following technical characteristics to support enterprise-grade AI operations:

=== Kubernetes-Native Deployment Flexibility
**Cloud-Native Architecture with BYOC and On-Premise Support**

Built as a Kubernetes-native platform, the architecture supports flexible deployment models including public cloud, private cloud, and on-premise environments. The Kubernetes foundation provides container orchestration, scaling, and resource management while enabling organizations to maintain infrastructure control and meet data residency and regulatory compliance requirements.

=== Centralized Governance Framework
**Agent Catalog and Lifecycle Management**

A comprehensive governance framework provides centralized agent catalog functionality for discovery, versioning, and lifecycle management. This enables organizational visibility and control across the entire agent ecosystem with standardized management interfaces.

=== Model Abstraction Layer
**LLM Provider Independence**

An agnostic model router abstracts differences between Large Language Model providers, providing intelligent routing and failover capabilities. This design enables seamless provider switching while maintaining consistent interfaces and operational behavior.

=== Observability and Audit Infrastructure
**Comprehensive Monitoring and Compliance Logging**

Built-in observability infrastructure provides comprehensive metrics collection, distributed tracing, and audit logging capabilities. This supports both operational monitoring requirements and regulatory compliance through complete audit trail maintenance.

=== Multi-Framework Runtime Support
**Heterogeneous Agent Execution Environment**

The runtime environment supports multiple agent frameworks and execution patterns within a unified operational model. This enables deployment of agents built with different frameworks while maintaining consistent operational characteristics and management interfaces.

=== Integrated Testing Framework
**Agent Validation and Quality Assurance**

A comprehensive testing framework provides agent validation, performance testing, and quality assurance capabilities. This ensures agent reliability and performance characteristics before production deployment through automated testing pipelines.

=== Standards-Based Architecture
**Interoperability and Forward Compatibility**

The architecture is built on open standards and protocols to ensure long-term interoperability and prevent vendor lock-in. This standards-based approach maintains architectural flexibility as AI technologies evolve.

== Requirements Overview

=== Agent Management and Orchestration
* **Agent Runtime / Agent Orchestration**: Kubernetes-native execution of agents with automated scaling and resource management
* **Agent Catalog**: Centralized discovery, versioning, and lifecycle management of agent instances
