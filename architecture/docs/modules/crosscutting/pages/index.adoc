== Capabilities and Plugins Principle

The Agentic Layer architecture embraces a fundamental design principle of **capabilities and plugins** that enables flexible switching of implementations for various system aspects. This approach promotes modularity, extensibility, and vendor independence across all major components.

=== Core Principle

The capabilities and plugins pattern allows the system to define stable interfaces while supporting multiple implementations. Each capability represents a well-defined set of functionality that can be fulfilled by different plugins, enabling runtime or deployment-time selection of the most appropriate implementation.

=== Key Benefits

**Implementation Independence**: Components depend on capabilities rather than specific implementations, reducing coupling and increasing flexibility.

**Vendor Neutrality**: Avoid vendor lock-in by supporting multiple implementations of the same capability.

**Runtime Flexibility**: Switch between implementations based on operational requirements, performance characteristics, or cost considerations.

**Extensibility**: Add new implementations without modifying existing code or disrupting running systems.

**Testing and Development**: Use different implementations for testing, development, and production environments.

=== Application Areas

==== Agent Gateway Implementations

The Agent or AI Gateway capability could support multiple reverse proxy and API gateway implementations:

* **Nginx**: Traditional reverse proxy for high-performance routing
* **Envoy**: Modern service mesh proxy with advanced traffic management
* **Kong**: API gateway with rich plugin ecosystem
* **Istio Gateway**: Kubernetes-native gateway with service mesh integration

=== Implementation Guidelines

==== Kubernetes-Native Capabilities

The Agentic Layer leverages **Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** as the interface definition mechanism for capabilities. Each capability is defined as a CRD that establishes the contract and configuration schema.

==== Plugin Definition through Custom Resources

Plugins are defined and configured using **Custom Resources (CRs)** that correspond to their capability CRDs. This approach provides:

* **Declarative Configuration**: Plugin instances are declared through Kubernetes manifests
* **Kubernetes-Native Management**: Leverage kubectl, operators, and existing K8s tooling
* **Version Control**: Plugin configurations are stored as code alongside infrastructure definitions

==== Standard Transport APIs

At the transport layer, the system uses **standard APIs** to ensure broad compatibility and interoperability.
